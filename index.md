## A litle bit about my self
Hello there! My name is Andualem Girma, I am a graduate student at the University of California Berkeley studying my Master of Science in Systems Engineering (concentration in Data Science). I am a MasterCard scholarship recipient at the university, currently in the second year of my studies, to be graduated in December. 

In addition to working as a research assistant on Switch-china project, A Systems Approach to Decarbonize Chinaâ€™s power system, I am also a student assistant at Berkeley International Office, University of California Berkeley.
I am obsessed with Machine learning and Optimization and I enjoy changing complex problems into algorithms and coming up with optimal solutions more than anything.

You can always hit me up if you would like to have a chat.

Stay blessed!
